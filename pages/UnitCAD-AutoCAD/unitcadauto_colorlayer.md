# Color, Layer



Color and Layer are also “generic” UnitCAD parameters in that they can be defined for any “Internal Entity” type of component and the color and layer will be accordingly assigned.

Color is defined in terms of Names such as “Red”, “Blue” etc.

Layer is defined in terms of layer name. If the layer already exists in the new model, it will be used. If not, a new layer will be created.

As you can sense, these two properties are also formula driven and so provide a powerful way of organizing your final drawing output.
