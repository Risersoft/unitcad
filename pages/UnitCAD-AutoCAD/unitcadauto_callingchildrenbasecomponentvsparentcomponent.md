# Calling Children in base component vs parent component



The fact that you can call children from any component at any level leaves you with a choice to make. You can create monolithic components with all children called in a single component or you can create smaller modular components called up as a hierarchy.

There are no rights and wrongs here and all depends on your unique situation.  As a general rule of thumb, components should be as modular and generic as possible to ensure reuse and reduce rework.
