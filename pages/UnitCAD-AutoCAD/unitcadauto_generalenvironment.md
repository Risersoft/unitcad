# General Environment



This section familiarizes you with the working environment of UnitCAD.

This and the following sections assume that UnitCAD has been properly setup, configured and running on the computer. If this is not the case, please refer Appendix on how to setup and configure.

UnitCAD is loaded as an add-in of AutoCAD. You can use the command line “UnitCAD” or the AutoCAD ribbon toolbar to launch UnitCAD. On the first launch the UnitCAD palette will be displayed. There are two “Hello World” messages displayed in the editor window to confirm that UnitCAD is now properly loaded.

This palette has the same features as a regular AutoCAD palette – it can be docked, resized and made floating. For more information please refer to AutoCAD online in the product or on the web.
