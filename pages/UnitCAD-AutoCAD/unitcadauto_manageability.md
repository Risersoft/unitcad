# Manageability



Often CAD Automation results in scattering away of design rules and makes further addition or changes tough. Because UnitCAD data is stored centrally in a SQL Server database, it leads to inherently easy management. The formulas are stored in a structured manner and can be easily viewed or changed. Similarly component definitions and their relationships are stored in a structured manner leading to easy listing, modifications and additions.

UnitCAD has been built with collaboration in mind. Whether you are two people sitting across each other or half way across planet, working in teams has never been easier. Formula and Component reuse means you can build on each otherâ€™s work.
