# Calling from parent



Design table based components are called from the parent components just like any other component. UnitCAD finds the appropriate row depending on the value of local parameter for selection in the context of the component. Once this row is found, UnitCAD looks up the row definition to either load a block from a file or move on to the child component defined in the row.
