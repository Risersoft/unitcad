# Component Tree



The power of UnitCAD lies in building up parametric modular components and then using them in multiple places. Hence a component can call several other components as children and be in turn called up by several parents. In this process we build up a chain of components - a component tree. The top level component is called up by the job and thus we build the complete model.
