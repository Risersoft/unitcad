# How to define and link in UnitCAD



To link a component definition with an AutoCAD parametric block, go to the Component tab of the Component Definition Screen.

Click on the browse button and select a file which contains the block definition you want to link. Upon selection, UnitCAD loads the file in AutoCAD window and loads information about all the blocks present in the file. These are listed in bottom left.

If you want to clear the selected file, click the Clear button.

If you want UnitCAD to fetch the block information again, press Refresh button.

On the right tab, a file preview is shown which is basically a preview of the modelspace.

To link the component definition to a block, you need to select one of the blocks listed. As soon as a block is selected and file preview tab is open, the block preview tab is activated automatically. This is basically a preview of the selected block, if it is available in the file.
