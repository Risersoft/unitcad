# Importing Parameters from Excel



You can import parameters from Excel file. Excel file should have the following structure

![](/images/import-from-excel-view.jpg)

When you select xls file, a dialog box such as the following is displayed:

![](/images/import-from-excel.png)

This gives the values of all parameters that were identified and their corresponding values. Formulas are updated to get their current value. Upon pressing OK, the values are modified in the parameter entry screen. If some parameters are not found, they are left untouched.
