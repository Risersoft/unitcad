# Attributes



A special treatment is given to block attributes. While you can update them using UnitCAD, it is purely optional. They are listed in the list of parameters of the blocks but a green or red bar does not depend on whether the attributes have been mapped or not.



To update an attribute, you would have a parameter with the same code as the attribute tag in the scope of the component. When this component is made, the attribute value will be automatically updated.

If an attribute does not have a matching parameter, the value as defined in the attribute default text box in AutoCAD will be used.
