# Mirroring – Mirror, MirDel

![](/images/mirroring-comp-def.jpg)

Mirroring and Mirdel are very similar actions with one difference – MirDel changes the original entity while Mirror adds a new mirrored entity.

There are two ways of applying this action – you can define a mirroring line in “Entity2” you can define point1 and point2 which define the mirroring line. The presence or absence of formulas will determine which way is used by UnitCAD.

In this drawing, the circle at the top was mirrored using the mirror action. The rectangle at the bottom was mirrored using the MirDel Action.
