# Power without scripting



Traditionally 2D CAD automation has meant writing .NET or VBA or LISP scripts. FormulaCAD gives you the same or perhaps even greater power without writing a single line of code.

FormulaCAD consists of a vast library of functions which can be used while calculating parameters.

You choose whether your primary source of geometry will be pre-defined parametric CAD blocks or on-the-fly created geometry. And it can be a combination of both as well.

Best of all is the fact that there is no long code to learn, write and maintain. All the operations are driven by graphical user interface and formula writing is accompanied by a formula tester which enables easy and fast component definitions.
