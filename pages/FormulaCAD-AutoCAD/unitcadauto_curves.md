# Curves    

## Line



Component Code – Line

Parameter Groups – As shown below

![](/images/line-select.jpg)  

### Line2p (2 points)

![](/images/line2p-component-def-child.jpg)

![](/images/line2p-drawing3.png)

### Linept (point+tangent)

![](/images/linept-component-def-child.jpg)

Qty has been chosen as 2 and onright1 parameter has been formulated to have different values for each instance.

TanCurve1 is a string parameter which needs to evaluate into a circular entity.

C1 is a circle centred at (0,0) and with a radius of 20.

### Linepper (point+perpendicular)

![](/images/Linepper-component-def.jpg)

L2p is a previously created line.

### Line2t (tangent+tangent)

TanCurve1 and TanCurve2 are string parameters which need to evaluate into circular entity.

#### Circles Not Intersecting Case 1

#### Circles Not Intersecting Case 2

If two circles don’t intersect and one circle is completely constrained inside the other, no tangent is possible.

#### Circles Intersecting at 2 Points

#### Circles Intersecting at 1 Point Case 1

## Polyline

Code – Pline

Parameters – Pointlist, Bulgelist, Closed

Pointlist is the list of points

Bulgelist is the list of bulges. If the bulgelist parameter contains less items than pointlist, bulge is automatically taken as 0 for the remaining vertices.

Closed – If closed is set to 1 the polyline is closed.
