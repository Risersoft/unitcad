# General Environment



This section familiarizes you with the working environment of UnitCAD.

This and the following sections assume that UnitCAD has been properly setup, configured and running on the computer. If this is not the case, please refer Appendix on how to setup and configure.

UnitCAD is loaded as an add-in of Inventor. You launch UnitCAD using the “Launch UnitCAD” button in Inventor Ribbon Bar under the Tools tab. On the first launch the UnitCAD palette will be displayed.

This palette has the same features as a regular Inventor palette – it can be docked, resized and made floating. For more information please refer to Inventor online in the product or on the web.
