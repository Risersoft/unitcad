# Design Table Export and Import



Design Tables can be exported and imported.

To Export select the export button on the design table data screen. UnitCAD design table files (* .ucadt) contain information about both the structure and data of the table.

To import select the Import Table button from the New menu.

You can select any ucadt file. Upon doing the “Import Table” screen will be presented which will have the data contained in the file.

You can save the table by pressing the OK button. However if the design table code is already present, an error dialog box will be displayed.
