# Power without Scripting



Dynamic Assembly traditionally means either going for scripting or investing in expensive ETO solutions. UnitCAD gives you the same or perhaps even greater power without writing a single line of code.

UnitCAD consists of a vast library of functions which can be used while calculating parameters.

Best of all is the fact that there is no long code to learn, write and maintain. All the operations are driven by graphical user interface and formula writing is accompanied by a formula tester which enables easy and fast component definitions.
