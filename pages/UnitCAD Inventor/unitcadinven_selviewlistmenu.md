# Selecting Views from the List Menu



When a view is selected from the list menu, it may have some pre-defined filters attached to it. For example, the “Work orders” menu command has a “Completed=No” filter attached to it. So every time this command is clicked, the Completed filter is set to No.

Whenever a new view is requested, it adjusts the height of the filter display area to include all filters that are applicable to the running view.
