# Introduction



These quick start tutorials are designed to provide a sneak peek of what’s inside FormulaCAD. You may not understand all of what’s going on but just believe and continue. At the end of it, you are sure to get a flavor of the features and capabilities. You can then read the documentation to get a more methodical understanding of how to operate.

The tutorials assume that FormulaCAD has been setup properly and you can get to the opening FormulaCAD screen. If you are not sure, please refer the section on Setup.
