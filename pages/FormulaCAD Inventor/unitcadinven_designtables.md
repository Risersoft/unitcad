# Design Tables



Design tables are used to maintain data. More often than not, in the drawing office you have a number of dependent parameters for each independent parameter. For example, if the bolt dia is 16, the thickness of nut, dia of the bolt head, thickness of washer etc are all automatically fixed. Hence only the dia can be specified and the rest of the data can be maintained in the design tables and “looked up” during geometry creation.  For more information, refer to the function “mxlookup” in function reference.

You can also have a library of components based on each row of design table selected during run time base on parameters. For more information, please refer the topic “Design Table based components”

FormulaCAD provides an easy and flexible method of maintaining such data. You can define you own columns and edit the table structure as you go along.
