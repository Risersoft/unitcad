# Defining Rows

Once it is set up, select the "Table Rows” tab. This will display two grids one below another. The top grid lists all rows which have been defined. The bottom grid lists all rows which have not been defined.

To move from undefined to defined, select any row in the bottom grid, and click “Add”

You have two options here – either you can select a child component or select a part file.

 If you select a part file, you see a scaled down version of the information you see when you select a part file in a full blown component definition.

To edit select the row in the top and press edit.

To delete, select any row in the top and press delete. After deletion, this row will move to the bottom grid.
