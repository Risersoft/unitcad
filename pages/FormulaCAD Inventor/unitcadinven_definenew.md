Select the Design Table from the “Design Table for Columns” combo box. Design Table for data is automatically filled up. These two fields are almost always the same.

The Select Columns Table in the right will also be populated. You can select which of the columns you wish to display in the list of component in the “Table Rows” tab.

Define a local parameter with an appropriate code and name and select this parameter in the “Local Parameter” combo box. This will be the parameter which will need to be called up by the parent.
