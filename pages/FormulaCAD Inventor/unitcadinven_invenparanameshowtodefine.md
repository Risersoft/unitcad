# How to define and link in FormulaCAD



To link a component definition with an Inventor File, go to the Component tab of the Component Definition Screen.

![](/images/component-defition-invenparanems.jpg)

Click on the browse button and select a file. Upon selection, FormulaCAD loads the file in Inventor window and loads parameters present in the file hierarchy.

If you want to clear the selected file, click the Clear button.

If you want FormulaCAD to fetch the parameter information again, press Refresh button.
