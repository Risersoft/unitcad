# Design Table Data



Once structure is defined, you save the design table and then select “Edit Design Table data” from the context menu.

In the data entry screen you can add or deletes rows. For each column, data type as selected during structure definition will be enforced.

You can move the rows up or down using “move up” and “move down” buttons. You can insert in between by positioning on a row and pressing “insert”.

To copy from a row, select a row or a set of rows and press copy. Select a destination row and press “Paste Rows” to paste complete rows or “Paste cells” to paste only the selected column. Please note that FormulaCAD uses an internal clipboard to support this functionality and the Windows clipboard is not affected.
