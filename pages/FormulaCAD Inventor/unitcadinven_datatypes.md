# Data Types



Global parameters have to be assigned a data type. FormulaCAD follows an easy and flexible data type system. There are four data types for global parameters -

**String**

This is the string / text data type.


**Number**

Can be decimal or integer. Supports large no. of decimal points.


**Boolean**

Yes / No or True / False


**Point**

Point is a special type added by FormulaCAD. It is generally expressed as (x,y) or (x,y,z). Point (x,y) is converted to (x,y,0). This parameter can be directly inputted and used by components enabling easy geometry construction.
